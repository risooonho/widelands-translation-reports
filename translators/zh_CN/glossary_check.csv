The lumberjack’s hut is a small building, so I will go on to select the small buildings tab. Then I’ll choose the lumberjack’s hut.","首先，我在想建伐木屋的地方的标志上左键单击。会出现一个窗口，我要在上面选择建筑。因为我要点一个黄色的标志——那意味着这个地方可以建造中小型建筑—— 这里是所有我能建的中型建筑。伐木屋是小型建筑。所以我会选择小型建筑标签，然后选择伐木屋。","scenario_tutorial01_basic_control.wmf","../../data/campaigns/tutorial01_basic_control.wmf/scripting/texts.lua:75"
